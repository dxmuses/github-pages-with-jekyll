Hello! This is a new post.
I don't know what should I write here, so I'll talk about Prefab sprout which happens to be my favorite band/artist.
You should definitely listen to them. They're amazing!
Here are some songs for example:

[Hallelujah](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MiO2V3csrA4) from the album Steve McQueen

[Don't Sing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-IpBRMm_QAg) from Swoon

[Johnny Johnny](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3ghbfBfPLM) also from Steve McQueen

Let me know if you like them!
